# hello python world :)

this is my repo of learning python. it's just for me to play around.

I'm learning python together with my kids. and games are a lot more fun than just pure data processing... (at least for the kids)

I completely forgot to mention the book itself....

It's a book from Al Sweigart called "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python". It's a nice book to begin with. It's available in German and English, and probably also in other languages I don't know of.

Have fun!

Cheers
