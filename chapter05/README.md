# chapter 5

## the dragon realm

at least the title is so far the kid's favorite.

a very simple game is created where the user has to choose between two different caves. one with a evil dragon and one with a nice one. I don't have to mention that you'll die if you pick the wrong one.

there is a nice simple flowchart displayed in the book to describe the flow of the program to write. it helps to understand how to design the program.

this chapter introduces the concept of functions to the kids. this makes it reusable.
